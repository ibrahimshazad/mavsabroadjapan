This is an ongoing project based on development of a progressive web app for UTA's study abroad group to japan. The appâ€™s purpose is to help students navigate and find exciting information about places they will be visiting, act as a messenger between group leader and the students and provide any additional features that will smoothen their experience during the visit.
